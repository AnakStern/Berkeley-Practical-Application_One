# Berkeley-Practical-Application_One

## Brief clarification notes:
### 1. The description of the "time" column provided did not include all the times contained in the time column of the dataset 
### 2. Question 4 asks about "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month".  Values for the Bar column only show "1 to 3 times"

## A. Data Adjustments
### 1. Dropped the "car" column; 99% of values were missing
### 2. Dropped rows with missing values
### 3. Renamed the misspelled "passanger" column to "passenger"
### 4. (later in the analysis) Created new column to make "temperature" into a datatype integer
### 5. (later in the analysis) Created new columns to categorize "income" with dichotomous values "lower income" and "high income"

## B. Analysis of acceptance of bar coupons
### Approximately 41% of drivers who received a coupon for a bar accepted the coupon
### Overall, drivers who went to a bar more often were significantly more likely to accept a bar coupon.
### About 76% of drivers who went to a bar four or more times per month accepted the bar coupon.
### The influence of age on bar coupon acceptance was unclear and would need further analysis.
### The probability of accepting a bar coupon seems to be higher for drivers who had a passenger that was not a child ("kid").
### The analysis suggests that those who work in farming, fishing or forestry would be more likely to accept a bar coupon (all other things equal).

## C. Analysis of acceptance of coupons for more expensive restaurants
### Approximately 45% of drivers who received a coupon for an expensive accepted the coupon
### Overall, none of the factors analyzed had a significant impact on acceptance of a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
### These factors included time coupon received, driver havng a passenger, driver having children, and driver with no urgent destination.
### Drivers with high income ($75,000 or more) were only slighly more likely to accept a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
### This was not an exhaustive analysis.
### Other factors not analyzed or not in the available dataset may more clearly influence acceptance of a coupon for an expensive restaurant.
